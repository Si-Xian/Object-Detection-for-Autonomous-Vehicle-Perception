# Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicle-Perception

## Background
Computer vision is a field of AI that teaches the computer to recognize images. The computer is trained with bunch of images and it try to learn the patterns behind the images. In our project, we are trying to apply it in the autonomous vehicle industry, which means to detect the object arround the vehicles to enhance the decision making and road planning process. 

Deep learning is capable of dealing with the huge ammount of data for the images. For instances, a 1000 by 1000 images will represent 3M inputs, the basic machine learning model is not able to deal with this huge ammount of data. Besides, it is important to detect nearby vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists to avoid collisions. A high accuracy model is important for the safety of the road users.

##  Objective & Aim
The project aims to develop a model that is able to accurately identify and classify various road 
objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights, in real-time. Following objectives will 
be achieved:
1. To collect and pre-process the data, in the form that it can be used for training.
2. To perform an implementation of the Deep Learning model.
3. To perform hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance.
4. To validate and compare the results of the model with results done by others.
